# Geometrical Visualization & 7-s WEBM Capture

A lightweight, single-page web app that renders an animated 3-D wireframe cube whose  
size, rotation speed, color hue, and glow intensity can be adjusted in real time.  
Click **Download 7-s WEBM** to record exactly seven seconds of the live canvas and save it as a `.webm` file—no server or extensions required.

## Files

- **index.html** – complete page (WebGL + UI + capture logic)  
- **styles.css** – minimal styling for canvas and controls  
- **README.md** – this file

## Quick Start

1. Clone or download the three files into the same folder.
2. Open `index.html` in any recent Chromium-based desktop browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.).
3. Use the sliders to tweak the look.
4. Press **Download 7-s WEBM**.  
   After seven seconds, `geometry_7s.webm` will appear in your default downloads folder.

## Browser Support

- **Recording:** Chromium-based desktop browsers (MediaRecorder + WebM-writer-js).  
- **Rendering:** Any browser with WebGL 1.0 support.
